![Database Schema](sample.png)

## Overview
For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
